- New methods: `search.by_email()`, `search.coql_query()`, `notes.create()`

**Benefits:**
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Cleaner code organization
- Reduced complexity in main client

### 7. Specialized Email Processor ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `email_crm_sync/services/email_processor.py`
- Concrete implementation of `BaseProcessor` for email operations
- Integration with modular Zoho components and enhanced OpenAI client
- Comprehensive email validation and processing logic

**Features:**
- Full email processing workflow from Gmail to CRM
- AI-powered email summarization
- Record matching and note creation
- Robust error handling and logging
- Proper validation of email data

**Methods:**
- `process_emails()` - Batch email processing
- `_process_single_email()` - Individual email processing
- `process()` - Core processing logic
- `validate()` - Email data validation
- `cleanup()` - Resource cleanup

**Benefits:**
- Specialized processing logic for emails
- Better testability and maintainability
- Extensible architecture for future processors
- Integration with all refactored components

### 8. Comprehensive Integration Tests ✅

**Implementation:**
- Created `tests/test_refactored_architecture.py`
- Tests for all new modular components
