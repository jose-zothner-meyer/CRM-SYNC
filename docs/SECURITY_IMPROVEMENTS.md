# Security Improvements for Authorization Code Handling

## Issue Fixed
The authorization code was previously hard-coded in `tools/exchange_new_tokens.py`, which is a security risk as it could be accidentally committed to version control or exposed in logs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration File Updates
- Added `zoho_authorization_code` field to both `config/api_keys.yaml` and `examples/api_keys.yaml.example`
- The field is initially empty and should only be populated temporarily when needed

### 2. Script Improvements (`tools/exchange_new_tokens.py`)
- Removed hard-coded authorization code
- Added support for multiple secure input methods:
  1. **Command line argument** (recommended): `python exchange_new_tokens.py "your_auth_code"`
  2. **Environment variable**: `export ZOHO_AUTH_CODE="your_auth_code"`
  3. **Configuration file**: Temporarily add to `zoho_authorization_code` in `api_keys.yaml`

### 3. Security Enhancements
- Authorization code is automatically cleared from config file after successful use
- Better error messages guide users on secure usage
- Improved exception handling for network errors
- Added proper file encoding specifications

## Usage Examples

### Method 1: Command Line (Recommended)
```bash
python tools/exchange_new_tokens.py "1000.your_auth_code_here.xyz"
```

### Method 2: Environment Variable
```bash
export ZOHO_AUTH_CODE="1000.your_auth_code_here.xyz"
python tools/exchange_new_tokens.py
```

### Method 3: Configuration File (Temporary)
1. Add the authorization code to `config/api_keys.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   zoho_authorization_code: "1000.your_auth_code_here.xyz"
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python tools/exchange_new_tokens.py
   ```
3. The authorization code will be automatically cleared after successful use

## Best Practices
1. **Never commit authorization codes** to version control
2. Use authorization codes **immediately** after generation
3. **Clear authorization codes** from config files after use (done automatically)
4. **Use environment variables** for CI/CD environments
5. **Regenerate tokens** if you suspect they may have been exposed
